    Background Information: "Armistice of 11 November 1918 - wikipedia <H1> Armistice of 11 November 1918 </H1> Jump to : navigation , search `` Armistice with Germany '' and `` Armistice of Compiègne '' redirect here . For the day of commemoration , see Armistice Day . For a full list , see List of armistices involving Germany . Photograph taken in the forest of Compiègne after reaching an agreement for the Armistice <P> The Armistice of 11 November 1918 was the armistice that ended fighting on land , sea and air in World War I between the Allies and their last opponent , Germany . Previous armistices had eliminated Bulgaria , the Ottoman Empire and the Austro - Hungarian Empire . Also known as the Armistice of Compiègne from the place where it was signed , it came into force at 11 a.m. Paris time on 11 November 1918 ( `` the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month '' ) and marked a victory for the Allies and a complete defeat for Germany , although not formally a surrender . </P> <P> The actual terms , largely written by the Allied Supreme Commander , Marshal Ferdinand Foch , included the cessation of hostilities , the withdrawal of German forces to behind the Rhine , Allied occupation of the Rhineland and bridgeheads further east , the preservation of infrastructure , the surrender of aircraft , warships , and military matériel , the release of Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians , and eventual reparations . No release of German prisoners and no relaxation of the naval blockade of Germany was agreed . </P> <P> Although the armistice ended the fighting , it needed to be prolonged three times until the Treaty of Versailles took effect on 10 January 1920 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 October 1918 telegrams </Li> <Li> 2 German Revolution </Li> <Li> 3 Negotiation process <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Allied Rhineland occupation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Prolongation </Li> <Li> 5 The Armistice Carriage ( railroad car ) </Li> <Li> 6 Key personnel </Li> <Li> 7 Terms </Li> <Li> 8 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 9 Last casualties </Li> <Li> 10 Legacy </Li> <Li> 11 Stab - in - the - back myth </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 Notes and references </Li> <Li> 14 Bibliography </Li> <Li> 15 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> October 1918 telegrams ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( November 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> Front page of the `` New York Times '' on 11 November 1918 <P> On 29 September 1918 the German Supreme Army Command informed Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor , Count Georg von Hertling at Imperial Army Headquarters in Spa of occupied Belgium , that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless . Quartermaster General Erich Ludendorff , probably fearing a breakthrough , claimed that he could not guarantee that the front would hold for another two hours and demanded a request be given to the Entente for an immediate ceasefire . In addition , he recommended the acceptance of the main demands of US president Woodrow Wilson ( the Fourteen Points ) including putting the Imperial Government on a democratic footing , hoping for more favorable peace terms . This enabled him to save the face of the Imperial German Army and put the responsibility for the capitulation and its consequences squarely into the hands of the democratic parties and the parliament . As he said to officers of his staff on 1 October : `` They now must lie on the bed that they 've made for us . '' </P> <P> On 3 October , the liberal Prince Maximilian of Baden was appointed Chancellor of Germany ( prime minister ) , replacing Georg von Hertling in order to negotiate an armistice . After long conversations with the Kaiser and evaluations of the political and military situations in the Reich , by 5 October 1918 , the German government sent a message to President Wilson to negotiate terms on the basis of a recent speech of his and the earlier declared `` Fourteen Points '' . In the subsequent two exchanges , Wilson 's allusions `` failed to convey the idea that the Kaiser 's abdication was an essential condition for peace . The leading statesmen of the Reich were not yet ready to contemplate such a monstrous possibility . '' As a precondition for negotiations , Wilson demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories , the cessation of submarine activities and the Kaiser 's abdication , writing on 23 October : `` If the Government of the United States must deal with the military masters and the monarchical autocrats of Germany now , or if it is likely to have to deal with them later in regard to the international obligations of the German Empire , it must demand not peace negotiations but surrender . '' </P> <P> In late October , Ludendorff , in a sudden change of mind , declared the conditions of the Allies unacceptable . He now demanded to resume the war which he himself had declared lost only one month earlier . However the German soldiers were pressing to get home . It was scarcely possible to arouse their readiness for battle anew , and desertions were on the increase . The Imperial Government stayed on course and Ludendorff was replaced by Wilhelm Groener . On 5 November , the Allies agreed to take up negotiations for a truce , now also demanding reparation payments . </P> <P> The latest note from Wilson was received in Berlin on 6 November . That same day , the delegation led by Matthias Erzberger departed for France . </P> <P> A much bigger obstacle , which contributed to the five - week delay in the signing of the Armistice and to the resulting social deterioration in Europe , was the fact that the French , British and Italian governments had no desire to accept the `` Fourteen Points '' and President Wilson 's subsequent promises . For example , they assumed that the de-militarization suggested by Wilson would be limited to the Central Powers . There were also contradictions with their post-War plans that did not include a consistent implementation of the ideal of national self - determination . As Czernin points out : </P> <P> The Allied statesmen were faced with a problem : so far they had considered the `` fourteen commandments '' as a piece of clever and effective American propaganda , designed primarily to undermine the fighting spirit of the Central Powers , and to bolster the morale of the lesser Fourteen Points . Now , suddenly , the whole peace structure was supposed to be built up on that set of `` vague principles '' , most of which seemed to them thoroughly unrealistic , and some of which , if they were to be seriously applied , were simply unacceptable . </P> <H2> German Revolution ( edit ) </H2> Main article : German Revolution of 1918 -- 19 <P> The sailors ' revolt which took place during the night of 29 to 30 October 1918 in the naval port of Wilhelmshaven spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and to the announcement of the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II . </P> <P> Also on 9 November , Max von Baden handed over the office of Chancellor to Friedrich Ebert , a Social Democrat . Ebert 's SPD and Erzberger 's Catholic Centre Party had enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the Imperial government since Bismarck 's era in the 1870s and 1880s . They were well represented in the Imperial Reichstag , which had little power over the government , and had been calling for a negotiated peace since 1917 . Their prominence in the peace negotiations would cause the new Weimar Republic to lack legitimacy in right - wing and militarist eyes . </P> <H2> Negotiation process ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Armistice was the result of a hurried and desperate process . The German delegation headed by Matthias Erzberger crossed the front line in five cars and was escorted for ten hours across the devastated war zone of Northern France , arriving on the morning of 8 November . They were then entrained and taken to the secret destination , aboard Ferdinand Foch 's private train parked in a railway siding in the forest of Compiègne . </P> <P> Foch appeared only twice in the three days of negotiations : on the first day , to ask the German delegation what they wanted , and on the last day , to see to the signatures . The Germans were handed the list of Allied demands and given 72 hours to agree . The German delegation discussed the Allied terms not with Foch , but with other French and Allied officers . The Armistice amounted to complete German demilitarization ( see list below ) , with few promises made by the Allies in return . The naval blockade of Germany was not completely lifted until complete peace terms could be agreed upon . </P> <P> There was no question of negotiation . The Germans were able to correct a few impossible demands ( for example , the decommissioning of more submarines than their fleet possessed ) , extended the schedule for the withdrawal and registered their formal protest at the harshness of Allied terms . But they were in no position to refuse to sign . On Sunday 10 November , they were shown newspapers from Paris to inform them that the Kaiser had abdicated . That same day , Erzberger was instructed to sign by Ebert . The cabinet had earlier received a message from Hindenburg , requesting that the armistice be signed even if the Allied conditions could not be improved on . </P> <P> The Armistice was agreed at 5 : 00 a.m. on 11 November , to come into effect at 11 : 00 a.m. Paris time ( noon German time ) , for which reason the occasion is sometimes referred to as `` the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month '' . Signatures were made between 5 : 12 a.m. and 5 : 20 a.m. , Paris time . </P> <H3> Allied Rhineland occupation ( edit )"
